Todo
========

This todo list tracks my tasks for a given day, changing colors to display their current state.

I'm looking to make a todo list that compensates for my laziness by nagging appropriately and preventing me from simply deleting undone tasks at the end of the day.

White: uncompleted task.
Red: uncompleted task, automatically carried over from previous day.
Green: Task is currently in progress. Todo will keep track of time spent performing task.
Aqua: completed task. A red task that is completed will vanish from the current day's display and show up in aqua on the day it was created.
Yellow: I didn't have the guts to finish this task and marked it 'slacked'. A slacked task cannot be deleted, as testament to procrastination.
